This paper is about Explainable AI (XAI), a field focused on making "black box" artificial intelligence systems understandable to humans.

It explores the serious problems caused by opaque AI, such as perpetuating bias in healthcare and the justice system. The paper then introduces XAI as the solution, detailing key techniques like LIME and SHAP that help us understand why an AI makes a specific decision.

Finally, it showcases the real-world impact of XAI with examples from around the globe and in India, and looks toward the future of creating more trustworthy and collaborative AI.
